    <h1>My Favorite Terraria Content Mods</h1>
    <h2>What is Terraria?</h2>
    <p>Terraria is a 2D sandbox action-adventure game made by Re-logic. The game was first published in May of 2011, and since then, it has been posted to numerous platforms and is still receiving updates.</p>
    <p>I play this game too much and so I went to look at mods that added new content as if it was free downloadable content. I found a couple that I really loved; Here they are.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Calamity Mod  
      <img src="media/calamity.png" alt="Calamity Mod">
        <p>Currently the most downloaded mod in the tModLoader workshop in Steam, and for good reason as well.</p>
        <p>The mod adds more hours into a game, which already takes a ton of hours to beat, and includes content and game progression even after beating the base game's final boss.</p>
        <p>Calamity adds tons of new bosses, biomes, thousands of items, NPCs, and even harder difficulty options.</p>
       <p>Calamity also has a pretty cool soundtrack, with the head composer being DM Dokuro. Here's one of my favorites.</p>

      </li>
      <li>Thorium Mod
      <img src="media/thorium.png" alt="Thorium Mod">
        <p>Thorium feels as if the developers of Terraria itself made an update to the game.</p>
        <p>Along with adding more bosses, even more items than Calamity, and NPCs, there are also 3 new classes added in this mod.</p>
      </li>
      <li> Fargo's Soul Mod
        <img src="media/fargos.png" alt="Fargo's Soul Mod">
        <p>Take Terraria and turn it into Dark Souls, along with adding an unnecessarily large crafting tree.</p>   
        <p>Fargo's Soul Mod's primary features include adding a difficulty mode which almost completely changes the way enemies and bosses work, and with that, it also adds numerous crafting recipes which all build up to a single, powerful accessory at the end of the game.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
   <p>I have played all of these mods twice or thrice now, with Calamity being the most repeatedly played mod by me. I do not even know how many times I have replayed that mod.</p>
   <p>I hope that, if you have Terraria, and if you have enoughb experience in that game, that you try out these mods (I do not recommend trying out Fargo's Soul Mod first).</p>
   <p>Thank you for reading!</p>
